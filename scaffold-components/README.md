# newchain

**newchain** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint. It was created with [chainsaw](https://github.com/github_username/chainsaw)
and the [Ignite/Tendermint Toolchain](https://ignite.com/cli).

## Getting Started

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies and start the blockchain
ignite chain serve

# Build the application
make build

# Run tests
make test
```

### Configuration

Your blockchain can be configured through several files:
- `config.yml`: Main chain configuration
- `app/app.go`: Application initialization and module setup
- `x/`: Custom modules directory
- `proto/`: Protocol buffer definitions

## Features

- Built on Cosmos SDK for robust blockchain functionality
- Tendermint consensus for fast finality
- Modular architecture for extensibility
- IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) ready
- Configurable tokenomics
- Built-in governance module
- Customizable staking parameters

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

See [Deploying a testnet](./deploy/README.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Setting up validator nodes
- Configuring seed nodes
- Managing the block explorer
- Monitoring and maintenance

### Infrastructure Components

The deployment includes:
- Validator nodes for consensus
- Seed nodes for P2P networking
- Block explorer for chain monitoring
- Load balancers for API distribution
- Automated DNS configuration
- Security group management

## Development

### Module Development

Custom modules can be added using Ignite CLI:
```bash
ignite scaffold module my-module
```

### Message Types

Create new message types:
```bash
ignite scaffold message create-post title body
```

### API Development

- REST API endpoints are auto-generated
- gRPC endpoints available for efficient communication
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation included

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific tests
go test ./x/newchain/...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...
```

## Security

- Keep private keys secure and backed up
- Use separate keys for validators and accounts
- Enable firewall rules in production
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor chain health and performance
